# CSS_100_DAY_CHALLANGE
## What is this?
For 100 consecutive days, I've written HTML and CSS snippets as a creative learning process for myself.
I used CodePen to write and save my code and published my results every day on this website ðŸ‘‰ [100 Days CSS Challange](https://100dayscss.com/)
## How can I join?
All you need to get started with the challenge is a CodePen account and a passion for programming (yes, I assumed that writing HTML & CSS is programming).

The homepage shows every day a different challenge which you can complete. Use the provided template, be creative and recreate the example in your own way.

If you miss a day, you can simply change the day by clicking on the arrow icons below the example on the homepage and submit your result later.

You can check your progress at any time here and if you are dedicated, you might even make it to the leaderboard ðŸ‘‰ [Leaderboard](https://100dayscss.com/leaderboard/).
